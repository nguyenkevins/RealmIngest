We know your Toyota is an important part of your life and something you depend on every day. That’s why we’re dedicated to building products of the highest quality and reliability.Our excellent warranty coverage is  evidence that we stand behind the quality of our vehicles. We’re confident — as you should be — that your Toyota will provide  you with many years of enjoyable driving.To further demonstrate our commitment to  our customers’ satisfaction, occasionally  we may establish a special policy  adjustment to pay for specific repairs that  are no longer covered by warranty. When  we establish such a policy adjustment, we mail details to all applicable owners we  have on record. To provide you with added protection  against unexpected service costs, we offer Toyota Financial Services vehicle service agreements and Toyota Auto Care and  Toyota Care Plus prepaid maintenance programs. Each offers plans to meet a  wide variety of needs. Your dealership can help you select the plan that’s best for you.Our goal is for every Toyota customer to  enjoy outstanding quality, dependability  and peace of mind throughout their  ownership experience. We want you to be  a satisfied member of the Toyota family  for many miles to come.This booklet describes the terms of Toyota warranty coverage as well as  general owner responsibilities. The scheduled maintenance section describes your vehicle’s maintenance requirements. Be sure to review this information carefully, since proper maintenance is required to ensure that warranty coverage remains intact.All information in this booklet is the latest available at the time of publication and is subject to change without notice.SATISFACTION DOWN THE ROAD127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   4127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   4 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM5 IntroductionIF YOU NEED ASSISTANCEINTRODUCTIONBoth Toyota and your Toyota dealer  are dedicated to serving your automotive needs. Your complete satisfaction is our first priority. Should  you have a problem or concern — either during or after the warranty period —  please take the following steps to ensure  the quickest possible response:Step 1Discuss the situation with a dealership manager, such as the service manager  or customer relations manager. In most  cases, a satisfactory solution can be  reached at this step.Step 2If the dealership does not address your concern to your satisfaction, call the  Toyota Customer Experience Center  at (800) 331-4331.Please have the following information  ready when you call:• Your Toyota’s vehicle identification number (located on the driver’s side corner of the dashboard, under the windshield)• Current mileage on your vehicle• Name of your Toyota dealershipA Toyota customer relations representative will assist you in working with the dealership to find a satisfactory solution.Step 3If your concern has still not been resolved  to your satisfaction, Toyota offers  additional assistance through the Dispute Settlement Program, a dispute resolution program administered by the National  Center for Dispute Settlement. The  purpose of the Dispute Settlement  Program is to resolve disputes through arbitration — a process by which two  parties authorize an independent third  party to hear and resolve a dispute. The program is informal and free of charge.  To request that your case be reviewed  through the program, complete the  customer claim form in the Owner’s  Warranty Rights Notification  booklet  (found in your glove box) and mail it to:National Center for Dispute Settlement P.O. Box 515284Dallas, TX 75251-5284To initiate arbitration, you must complete  an NCDS customer claim form and mail it  to NCDS. To request a form, call NCDS  at (800) 777-8119 or obtain a copy at  www.ncdsusa.org. When you call,  please have your vehicle identification  number, the current mileage on your  Toyota and the names of your selling  and servicing dealerships.127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   5127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   5 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM6 IntroductionIF YOU NEED ASSISTANCEINTRODUCTIONCalifornia residents:  Toyota offers  assistance through an informal dispute  settlement program called the California  Dispute Settlement Program (CDSP). A  brochure about the program is found in  your glove box. For additional information,  call the Toyota Customer Experience  Center at (800) 331-4331. You may also contact the CDSP directly at (888) 300-6237. Failure to use the CDSP may affect your  rights and remedies under California’s   “Lemon Laws.”This information about the Dispute  Settlement Programs is correct as of the  date of printing. However, the programs  may be changed without notice. For the  most current information about the  programs, call the Toyota Customer Experience Center at (800) 331-4331.127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   6127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   6 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM7 IntroductionINTRODUCTION THE NEW WORLD OF  ANTI-THEFT TECHNOLOGYThis Toyota vehicle may be equipped  with an electronic “immobilizer” anti-theft  system. When the key is inserted into the  ignition switch, it transmits an electronic  code to an immobilizer computer. The  engine will only start if the code in the  key matches the code in the immobilizer.  If the code does not match, the immobilizer disables the ignition and fuel systems.  While an exact physical copy of the key  will open the door and allow retrieval of  items locked in the vehicle, it won’t start  the vehicle unless the key has the same  code as the immobilizer.  SECURITYFor security purposes, access to key  codes and service procedures for electronically registering replacement  keys is restricted. Only a Toyota dealer  or certain bonded/registered independent locksmiths can generate replacement keys.THE IMMOBILIZER KEY127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   7127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   7 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM8 IntroductionINTRODUCTION  REPLACING THE KEYUpon purchase, each vehicle should have  two master keys and an aluminum tag  with a key code imprinted on it.To generate a fully functional replacement  key (one that will both open the doors and start the engine), one of the master keys  is required. To make a key that will open  the door for retrieval of items locked  inside the vehicle, the aluminum key-code  tag can be used. If a master key or the aluminum key-code tag is not available,  a Toyota dealer or certain registered  locksmiths can obtain the key code from  a restricted-access database. These  businesses can also access a service  utility to reprogram the immobilizer if  all registered master keys have been  lost. If a Toyota dealer is not available,  please refer to www.aloa.org  to find  a bonded/registered locksmith who  performs high-security key service.  KEEPING THE KEY SAFE Replacing an immobilizer key may be  costly. It is advisable to keep a spare  master key and the aluminum key-code  tag in a safe place. If you record the  key code in more than one place, do not record it in a way that can be easily  identified and associated with the vehicle.  It is wise to keep a copy of the key code outside of the vehicle.If the vehicle was delivered with less than two keys and the aluminum key-code tag, consider having the Toyota dealer or a qualified independent automotive locksmith make a duplicate key before you need it.THE IMMOBILIZER KEY127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   8127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   8 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM9 IntroductionINTRODUCTIONWe realize that your confidence  in the quality and reliability  of our products was a key  factor in your decision to buy a Toyota.

However, use of replacement parts  that are not equivalent in quality to  Toyota Genuine Parts may impair  the effectiveness of the emission  control systems.If you use replacement parts that have maintenance or replacement schedules different from those of Toyota Genuine  Parts, you must follow the maintenance  and replacement schedules for the parts  you are using. In addition, you should  ensure that such parts are warranted by  their manufacturers to be equivalent to  Toyota Genuine Parts.

These records should include date of service, mileage at time  of service and a description of service performed and/or parts installed. For  your convenience, a maintenance log is included in this booklet. If you sell your vehicle, you should give your maintenance records to the new owner.Toyota will not deny a warranty claim  solely because you do not have records to show that you maintained your vehicle. However, damage or failure caused by  lack of proper maintenance is not  covered under warranty. WHERE TO GO FOR MAINTENANCEYou may have maintenance performed  on your vehicle by any qualified person  or facility. However, Toyota recommends having maintenance performed by an authorized Toyota dealership.Toyota dealership technicians are specially trained to maintain and repair Toyota  vehicles. They stay current on the latest service information through Toyota  technical bulletins, service publications  and training courses. Many are also  certified through the Toyota Certification Program, which involves a series of  rigorous written examinations. Feel free  to ask any Toyota dealership to show you  their technicians’ credentials.You can be confident you’re getting the  best possible service for your vehicle  when you take it to a Toyota dealership.127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   30127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   30 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM31 Your ResponsibilitiesWARRANTYOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE  REPLACEMENT PARTS Warranty coverage is not dependent  upon the use of any particular brand  of replacement parts. However, Toyota recommends using only Toyota Genuine  Parts when you need to replace a part  on your vehicle. Like all Toyota products,  Toyota Genuine Parts are built to the  highest standards of quality, durability  and performance. They are also designed  to fit your vehicle’s exact specifications.Your Toyota dealership maintains an  extensive inventory of Toyota Genuine  Parts to meet your vehicle service needs.  And because it is linked electronically to Toyota’s Parts Distribution Centers, the dealership has quick access to any parts  it may not have in stock.  Toyota Genuine Parts are covered by their  own warranty (see your dealer for details)  or the remainder of any applicable New  Vehicle Limited Warranty, whichever is  longer. Parts that are not Toyota Genuine Parts, or any damage or failures resulting from their use, are not covered by any  Toyota warranty.127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   31127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   31 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM32 Your ResponsibilitiesWARRANTY  BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION In the United States, U.S. Territories, Canada and MexicoTo obtain warranty service in the United States, U.S. territories, Canada or Mexico, take your vehicle to an authorized Toyota dealership. If your vehicle cannot be  driven, contact your nearest Toyota  dealership for towing assistance. You do  not have to pay for towing to the nearest Toyota dealership if your vehicle is inoperable due to failure of a warranted part.Outside the United States, U.S. Territories, Canada and MexicoIf you are using your vehicle outside the United States, U.S. territories, Canada and Mexico and need warranty service, contact  a local Toyota dealership. Please note, however, that your vehicle may not be repaired free of charge because the local Toyota distributor may have no obligation  to provide warranty service for your  vehicle, and/or your vehicle may not  comply with local regulatory or  environmental requirements.  EMERGENCY REPAIRSIf your vehicle is inoperable or unsafe to  drive and there is no Toyota dealership reasonably available to make repairs, you  may perform the repairs yourself or have  them performed by another automotive service provider. Toyota will reimburse you  for any of the repairs that are covered by  warranty. To receive reimbursement, present to an authorized Toyota dealership your paid repair invoices and any parts that were removed from the vehicle. You will be reimbursed for warranted parts at the manufacturer’s suggested retail price and warranted labor at a geographically appropriate hourly rate multiplied by  Toyota’s recommended time allowance  for the repair.If your vehicle requires emergency repair, Toyota assumes no liability for subsequent failures caused by improper repairs or the  use of parts that are not Toyota Genuine  Parts unless you have the vehicle properly repaired in a timely manner. To ensure that  warranty coverage remains intact, have  your vehicle inspected by an authorized  Toyota dealership as soon as possible  after an emergency repair.OBTAINING WARRANTY SERVICE127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   32127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   32 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM33 Your ResponsibilitiesWARRANTYNOTES127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   33127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   33 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM34 Maintenance LogMAINTENANCETHE IMPORTANCE OF SCHEDULED MAINTENANCERegular maintenance is essential to obtaining the highest level of performance, safety and reliability from your Toyota.

You should keep detailed records of vehicle maintenance, including date of service, mileage at time  of service and a description of service  and/or parts installation performed. The scheduled maintenance log in this booklet  can help you document this information. If you sell your vehicle, be sure to give your maintenance records to the new owner.Toyota will not deny a warranty claim  solely because you do not have records to show that you maintained your vehicle. However, damage or failure caused by lack  of proper maintenance is not covered  under warranty.  Maintenance Providers Maintenance and repair services may be performed by you or by any automotive service provider you choose. Toyota will  not deny a warranty claim solely because  you used a service provider other than a Toyota dealership for maintenance and repairs. However, damage or failure  caused by improper maintenance or  repairs is not covered under warranty.Dealer-Recommended MaintenanceYour dealer may recommend more  frequent maintenance intervals or more maintenance services than those listed in  the scheduled maintenance log. These additional services are not required to maintain your warranty coverage. Ask your dealer to explain any recommended maintenance not included in the scheduled maintenance log.For a complete description of Toyota warranty coverages, see the Warranty Information portion of this booklet.127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   35127415_19-TCS-14193  Toyota WMG Camry/AWD 3_R2.indd   35 8/26/20   10:35 AM8/26/20   10:35 AM36 Maintenance LogMAINTENANCERegular maintenance is essential  to obtaining the highest level of performance, safety and reliability  from your Toyota.

If you are a low-mileage  driver, mark your calendar to remind  yourself to obtain maintenance every  six months.Documenting Your InvestmentTo help you verify that you’ve invested in proper maintenance, each maintenance checklist includes space for your Toyota dealership to certify that you obtained Genuine Toyota Service for your vehicle.
